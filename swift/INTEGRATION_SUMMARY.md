# CouchDB Swift Integration - Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the `couchdb-swift` library into the Node.js/Electron Swift addon project. The integration uses Swift Package Manager to manage dependencies and exposes CouchDB functionality to JavaScript through Objective-C bridges.

## What Was Done

### 1. Project Structure Changes

- Created `Package.swift` for Swift Package Manager
- Swift code is located at `src/SwiftCode.swift`
- Integrated `couchdb-swift-2.3.2` as a local package dependency

### 2. Files Modified

#### Swift Files
- `src/SwiftCode.swift` - Added CouchDB client wrapper and methods
- `Package.swift` - Created for dependency management

#### Objective-C Bridge Files
- `include/SwiftBridge.h` - Added CouchDB method declarations
- `src/SwiftBridge.m` - Added CouchDB method implementations

#### C++ Bridge Files
- `src/swift_addon.mm` - Added CouchDB method bindings for Node.js

#### JavaScript Files
- `js/index.js` - Added CouchDB method wrappers

#### Build Configuration
- `binding.gyp` - Updated to:
  - Use Swift Package Manager for building
  - Link Swift runtime libraries
  - Add proper rpath for Swift dynamic libraries
  - Copy generated Objective-C headers

### 3. Available CouchDB Methods

The following methods are now available in JavaScript:

- `initCouchDB(host, port, username, password)` - Initialize CouchDB client
- `getAllDBs(callback)` - Get list of all databases
- `createDB(dbName, callback)` - Create a new database
- `deleteDB(dbName, callback)` - Delete a database
- `insertDocument(dbName, documentJson, callback)` - Insert a document
- `getDocument(dbName, docId, callback)` - Get a document by ID

All methods use callbacks following Node.js conventions: `callback(result, error)`

### 4. Dependencies Integrated

The following Swift packages are now part of the build:
- CouchDBClient (main library)
- AsyncHTTPClient (HTTP client)
- SwiftNIO (networking framework)
- All transitive dependencies

All dependencies are statically linked into `libSwiftCode.a`.

## Build Process

```bash
cd swift
npm install
npm run build
```

The build process:
1. Runs `swift build -c release` to compile all Swift code and dependencies
2. Copies the resulting `libSwiftCode.a` static library
3. Generates Objective-C header from Swift code
4. Compiles Objective-C and C++ bridge code
5. Links everything into `swift_addon.node`

## Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Swift Package Manager Integration**: Integrated SPM with node-gyp build system
2. **Actor Initialization**: Handled Swift concurrency (actors) in synchronous Objective-C context
3. **Symbol Resolution**: Added proper rpaths for Swift runtime libraries
4. **Static Linking**: Ensured all dependencies are statically linked into the addon
5. **Header Generation**: Extracted and used SPM-generated Objective-C headers
6. **Async/Await Bridge**: Bridged Swift async/await to JavaScript callbacks

## Usage Example

See `COUCHDB_USAGE.md` for detailed usage examples.

Quick example:
```javascript
const swiftAddon = require('./swift/js/index.js')

// Initialize
swiftAddon.initCouchDB('localhost', 5984, 'admin', 'password')

// Get databases
swiftAddon.getAllDBs((dbs, error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error)
  } else {
    console.log('Databases:', dbs)
  }
})
```

## File Locations

- Swift source: `swift/src/SwiftCode.swift`
- Package definition: `swift/Package.swift`
- Objective-C bridge: `swift/src/SwiftBridge.m`, `swift/include/SwiftBridge.h`
- C++ bridge: `swift/src/swift_addon.mm`
- JavaScript wrapper: `swift/js/index.js`
- Built addon: `swift/build/Release/swift_addon.node`
- Usage guide: `swift/COUCHDB_USAGE.md`

## Notes

- The CouchDB client initialization is asynchronous internally
- All database operations use Swift's async/await, bridged to JavaScript callbacks
- The addon requires macOS 11.0 or later
- Swift concurrency runtime is automatically loaded at runtime
