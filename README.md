## @at
A unique Electron-based development framework. Native parts are written in Swift. Supports macOS only (for now). 
> NOTE: This project is being publicly built. It doesn't have any features to be a framework right now. But it'll be when it grows up.
### Setup
In order:
```
npm i
cd swift
npm i
```
Then everytime you want to build the Swift part build it like:
```
npm run build
```
then go out to the parent directory then run the Electron app:
```
cd ../
npm start
```
I generally open two terminal windows for this.
