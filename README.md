## at Swift support
Working on Swift support for at, only works on macOS right now. Will work on Swift for Windows and Linux too.
### Setup
Firstly:
```
npm i
```
secondly:
```
cd swift
npm i
```
Then everytime you want to build the Swift part build it like:
```
npm run build
```
then go out to the upper directory then run the Electron app:
```
cd ../
npm start
```
I generally open two terminal windows for this.
